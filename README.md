# Fake_News_Detection
üìåProject Overview:
Fake news detection is a crucial task in today's digital world, where misinformation spreads rapidly.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as real or fake using Logistic Regression. 
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques for text processing and feature extraction.
Datasets:
I have used Dataset from Kaggle platform.
Dataset Description:

id: unique id for a news article
title: the title of a news article
author: author of the news article
text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable
1: unreliable
0: reliable

üî• Features:
Data Preprocessing.
Handling missing values.
Stemming- process of reducing a word to its root word.
TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
Logistic Regression to train the model.
Predictive system.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
Python, scikit-lean, Pandas&Numpy, NLTK &re , joblib, Jupyter Notebook.
